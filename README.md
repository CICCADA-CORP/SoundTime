SoundTime is a self-hosted music streaming platform built with **Rust** and **SvelteKit**. Upload your music library, organize it into playlists, and share tracks across instances using **peer-to-peer networking** powered by [iroh](https://iroh.computer/) (by [n0.computer](https://n0.computer/)).

Unlike centralized platforms, SoundTime gives you full control over your music. Run it on your own server, connect with other SoundTime instances through encrypted P2P channels, and enjoy a modern, responsive listening experience.

## Features

### 🎵 Music Streaming
- **Upload & organize** — Drag-and-drop upload with automatic metadata extraction (artist, album, track number, cover art)
- **Adaptive streaming** — OPUS transcoding at 320/128/64 kbps with server-side caching
- **Waveform visualization** — Real-time audio waveform display powered by Symphonia
- **Lyrics support** — Fetch and display lyrics from multiple providers (Musixmatch, Lyrics.com)
- **Full-text search** — Search across tracks, albums, and artists instantly

### 📚 Library Management
- **Albums & artists** — Auto-organized from metadata with cover art support
- **Playlists** — Create, edit, and share public or private playlists
- **Personal libraries** — Curate your own collection from available tracks
- **Favorites & history** — Track your listening habits and bookmark songs
- **Batch upload** — Upload entire albums or folders at once

### 🌐 Peer-to-Peer Network
- **iroh-powered P2P** — Encrypted QUIC connections via [iroh](https://iroh.computer/) 0.96 for peer discovery and track sharing
- **Relay support** — NAT traversal through [n0.computer](https://n0.computer/) production relay servers
- **Content-addressed storage** — Tracks identified by BLAKE3 hashes via iroh-blobs
- **Distributed search** — Bloom filter-based routing sends queries only to relevant peers
- **Track health monitoring** — Auto-retry on failure, 3-strike dereference with automatic re-referencing when peers return online
- **Duplicate resolution** — Best-copy selection based on format quality, bitrate, sample rate, and peer availability
- **Incremental catalog sync** — Delta-based sync avoids re-sending already-known tracks
- **Network visualization** — Interactive D3.js force-directed graph of your P2P network topology
- **Peer management** — Add, ping, and manage connected peers from the admin panel
- **Public instance listing** — Optional registration on the SoundTime directory for discoverability

### 🛡️ Security & Privacy
- **Argon2id** password hashing (OWASP-recommended)
- **JWT authentication** — Short-lived access tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Rate limiting** — Per-IP throttling on auth endpoints via tower-governor
- **Security headers** — HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
- **CORS controls** — Configurable allowed origins

### 🤖 AI-Powered Features
- **Editorial playlists** — AI-generated curated playlists based on your library (OpenAI-compatible APIs)
- **Smart metadata enrichment** — Automatic metadata lookup via MusicBrainz

### 🌍 Internationalization
- 5 languages out of the box: **English**, **Français**, **Español**, **中文**, **Русский**
- Auto-detection from browser language
- Easy to add new translations

### 🔧 Administration
- **Dashboard** — Track counts, user stats, storage status at a glance
- **User management** — Roles (admin/user), banning, moderation
- **Content moderation** — Report system with review workflow
- **Storage management** — Integrity checks, S3 sync, filesystem monitoring
- **Instance settings** — Configurable from the admin panel

## Quick Start

### One-Click Install (recommended)

The fastest way to get SoundTime running on any machine (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CICCADA-CORP/SoundTime/main/install.sh | bash
```

or with `wget`:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CICCADA-CORP/SoundTime/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will automatically:
- ✅ Check prerequisites (Docker, Docker Compose, git)
- ✅ Clone the repository to `~/soundtime`
- ✅ Generate a secure `.env` with random secrets
- ✅ Pull multi-arch Docker images (works on x86_64 and Apple Silicon / ARM64)
- ✅ Start all services

> **Custom install path?** Set `SOUNDTIME_INSTALL_DIR` before running:
> ```bash
> SOUNDTIME_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/soundtime curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CICCADA-CORP/SoundTime/main/install.sh | bash
> ```

### Docker Compose (manual)

If you prefer to set things up manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CICCADA-CORP/SoundTime.git
cd SoundTime

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum, change JWT_SECRET to a random string

# Launch all services
docker compose up
```

Once started:
- 🎵 **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- 🔌 **API**: http://localhost:8080
- 🌐 **Nginx proxy**: http://localhost:8880

The first user to register automatically becomes the **admin**. Open the frontend and create your account to begin the setup wizard.

### Local Development

See the [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for a complete setup walkthrough.

**Prerequisites**: Rust 1.93+, Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 16

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up postgres -d

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Backend (terminal 1)
cd backend
cargo run

# Frontend (terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

See the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) for production setup with SSL, custom domain, S3 storage, and P2P configuration.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What is SoundTime?</strong></summary>
<br>
SoundTime is a self-hosted music streaming server. You install it on your own hardware, upload your personal music library, and stream it from anywhere — on desktop, mobile, or any device with a web browser.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the P2P network work?</strong></summary>
<br>
SoundTime uses <a href="https://iroh.computer/">iroh</a> to establish encrypted QUIC connections between instances. When enabled, your node can discover other SoundTime instances, exchange catalog metadata, and stream tracks directly peer-to-peer — without any central server. All connections go through NAT-traversal relay servers provided by <a href="https://n0.computer/">n0.computer</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data encrypted?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes. All P2P connections use end-to-end encryption via iroh's QUIC transport. Passwords are hashed with Argon2id (OWASP-recommended). API authentication uses short-lived JWT tokens.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use SoundTime without the P2P features?</strong></summary>
<br>
Absolutely. P2P is entirely optional. If you don't set the <code>P2P_ENABLED=true</code> environment variable, SoundTime works as a standalone self-hosted music server with no external connections.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What audio formats are supported?</strong></summary>
<br>
SoundTime supports MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, AAC, AIFF and most common formats via <a href="https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia">Symphonia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Serial-ATA/lofty-rs">Lofty</a>. Uploaded tracks can be transcoded to OPUS at 320/128/64 kbps for adaptive streaming.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How many users / tracks can it handle?</strong></summary>
<br>
SoundTime is designed for personal use, small or big communities. It has been tested with libraries of several thousand tracks and a handful of concurrent users. Performance depends primarily on your server's storage I/O and available memory.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run SoundTime on a Raspberry Pi?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes. The Docker images are multi-arch (x86_64 and ARM64). A Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB of RAM is sufficient for personal use. OPUS transcoding will be slower on ARM but works fine for a single user.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I update SoundTime?</strong></summary>
<br>

```bash
cd ~/soundtime  # or your install directory
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is there a mobile app?</strong></summary>
<br>
There is no dedicated mobile app — SoundTime is a progressive web application. The frontend is fully responsive and supports the <strong>Media Session API</strong>, so your phone's lock screen displays cover art, title, artist, and playback controls natively.
</details>

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

## License

SoundTime is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).

This means you can use, modify, and distribute SoundTime freely, but if you run a modified version as a network service, you must make the source code available to its users.
